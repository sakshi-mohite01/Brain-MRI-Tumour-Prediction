## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **High-Accuracy Tumour Classification** – CNN model achieving **97% accuracy** for brain tumour detection.  
- 🧠 **Tumour Segmentation** – Automatically segments tumour regions and overlays them on MRI scans for enhanced visualization.  
- 🔍 **Grad-CAM Explainability** – Generates heatmaps to illustrate which regions influenced predictions.  
- 📄 **Automated PDF Report Generation** – Creates detailed reports summarizing results for medical records.  
- 💬 **Interactive Chatbot** – Provides explanations and guidance to users based on prediction results.  
- 🛠 **User-Friendly Streamlit App** – Offers an interactive interface for tumour prediction, segmentation, and report generation.




## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **BRISC2025 Brain MRI Dataset**, sourced from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains MRI scans for brain tumour classification and segmentation tasks.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset contains two main folders:
- `classification_task` → MRI scans with labels for tumour classification.
- `segmentation_task` → MRI scans and corresponding masks for tumour segmentation.

### Download Link
You can download the dataset from Kaggle here:  
👉 [BRISC2025 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025)  

### Usage
After downloading:
1. Place the dataset folder in the root directory of this project.  
2. Rename it as `brisc2025/` so the code can access it easily.
