## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **High-Accuracy Tumour Classification** – CNN model achieving **97% accuracy** for brain tumour detection.  
- 🧠 **Tumour Segmentation** – Automatically segments tumour regions and overlays them on MRI scans for enhanced visualization.  
- 🔍 **Grad-CAM Explainability** – Generates heatmaps to illustrate which regions influenced predictions.  
- 📄 **Automated PDF Report Generation** – Creates detailed reports summarizing results for medical records.  
- 💬 **Interactive Chatbot** – Provides explanations and guidance to users based on prediction results.  
- 🛠 **User-Friendly Streamlit App** – Offers an interactive interface for tumour prediction, segmentation, and report generation.




## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **BRISC2025 Brain MRI Dataset**, available on Kaggle.  
The dataset contains two main folders:  
- `classification_task`  
- `segmentation_task`

📥 You can download the dataset here:  
👉 [BRISC2025 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025)

After downloading, place the dataset inside a folder named `brisc2025/` in the root of this project.
