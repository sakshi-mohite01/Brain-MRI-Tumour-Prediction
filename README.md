## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Brain MRI Tumour Prediction system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
It combines advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify brain tumour presence and segment tumour regions, helping medical professionals with accurate decision-making.  

Key highlights of the project:
- Tumour classification with **97% accuracy**
- Tumour segmentation with visual highlighting
- Grad-CAM explainability for deep learning predictions
- Automated PDF report generation
- Interactive chatbot for query resolution

## 🚀 Features
