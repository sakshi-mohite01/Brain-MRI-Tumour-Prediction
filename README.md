## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Brain MRI Tumour Prediction system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
It combines advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify brain tumour presence and segment tumour regions, helping medical professionals with accurate decision-making.  

Key highlights of the project:
- Tumour classification with **97% accuracy**
- Tumour segmentation with visual highlighting
- Grad-CAM explainability for deep learning predictions
- Automated PDF report generation
- Interactive chatbot for query resolution


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

This project uses the **BRISC2025 Brain MRI Dataset**, available on Kaggle.  
The dataset contains two main folders:  
- `classification_task`  
- `segmentation_task`

ðŸ“¥ You can download the dataset here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [BRISC2025 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/briscdataset/brisc2025)

After downloading, place the dataset inside a folder named `brisc2025/` in the root of this project.
